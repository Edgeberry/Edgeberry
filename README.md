> [!WARNING]
> The SDK is currently undergoing substantial changes in architecture. Because of this, no information is currently available or published. But we'll get to it as soon as possible!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Following IO pins are controlled by the Edgeberry application to use with the [Edgeberry Hardware](https://github.com/SpuQ/EdgeBerry?tab=readme-ov-file#edgeberry-hardware), and should not be used in your application to avoid unpredictable behavior: **GPIO5** (buzzer), **GPIO6** (button), **GPIO19** (status LED, red), **GPIO26** (status LED, green).
